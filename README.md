# splitadaLoRA

Simple experiments related to SplitAdaLoRA.

## Federated Averaging Example

This repository now includes a minimal implementation of the FedAvg algorithm
in `fedavg.py`. The script simulates several clients that train local linear
regression models and then aggregates them on a server using weighted
averaging.

Run the simulation with:

```bash
python fedavg.py
```

## Split LoRA Example

`split_lora.py` demonstrates a tiny module that attaches lowâ€‘rank adapters to
chunks of a frozen linear layer. Running the script trains the adapters to learn
the sum of its inputs:

```bash
python split_lora.py
```
